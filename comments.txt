why is label printing 2 in my case
Can I ask a question?
When I read frames from the camera and saved them for verification, I found that the real face was also judged to be a fake face. But when I use my phone's camera to take a picture to detect the real face, is it because my laptop camera is too low pixel? Is your camera 720P or higher? Can you please tell me what could be the reason for this?
