You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail
And fear surrounds me
You've never failed
And You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
And You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Oh, Jesus, You're my God!

I will call upon Your name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine

Remember, the devil can never take away the gift God gave you at birth but he is strong enough to blind you from that gift. I love everyone one of you. Open our eyes father and help us understand that it is not the size of faith but realize that its all about who our faith is in.
I love Jesus 🙏 ❤
BEAUTIFUL SONG MAY GOD BLESS.🙏😇

>cry 

>even harder to sleep..
💗
Faith in anything, is that quiet moment alone, when the lights dim and stop blinding, and the sounds fall away, and your soul starts to feel cold,
 like a there’s a chill blowing straight through you, and you start to think past now. 
You start to think about what’s past that wall you’ve built around the subject. A place with no warmth and no comfort. 
A place beautiful, and cold and piercing and fearful and lonely. Everyone thinks about it. What’s at the end of forever. Our forever. Will we be alone, will we be with those we love. With it hurt. Is it beautiful. Is it ugly. Who you are, who you’ll be, is it written? Does it matter? 


Death is the crow upon all our shoulders, the thing we all have in common, what makes us human. The deepest blackest shadow to our most blinding light. 

Why do we hurt each other. 
We will all face the same thing
We all fear it, even if we don’t admit it.
Why can’t we just… make sure no one is alone.
No breath wasted
No shiver gone unheeded

No matter what you believe at the end of the day, the night will always come, for all of us. 

We don’t have to go into the dark alone.
the most beautiful music in the world

There was so many times I curled up broken hands to pray. Emotionally...
And halfway through a prayer after i tremble in shackled tears. I cry and break down, like a crumbles of stone i put myself back together. I rose from my slumber, like new. A man of God. Nothing can hurt me anymore... Its freedom 😪
Going through some tough times again, asking God why you keep doing this to me, you’re never there for me saying I don’t believe you anymore but I just can’t stop believing in you, I love you Jesus, please get me through this.. I need you
This song made me think of what I do have and I’m grateful 🥲 because I want have my parents forever my best friends I have always said I don’t want to now what like is like without my parents they said you will have a wife and kids and you will love them so much but it hard to let people go you now for your hole life but they will smile 😭😭😭😭🤧🤧 this is one of the best songs ever
Que o espírito santo salte a quem estiver escutando está musica trazendo ousadia e coragem pra enfrentar essa vida 🔥🔥🔥🙌 acorda mundo acorda mundo pessoas precisam de Deus 🔥 nós precisamos uns dos outros 🔥 não percam tempo e se voltem ao senhor todo poderoso e que emana toda paz e que dar todo sentido a vida 🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥

Life is something we all share,
Just like oxygen in the air.
The way we live it, is up to us,
With a negative or with a plus.

Life is something we should cherish,
We never know when we’ll perish.
Live each and every single day,
Smell the flowers, stop and play.

Life is something we’ve been blessed,
Choice is yours; choose your quest.
Follow your passions, and you’ll be fine,
With the right attitude, you will shine.

I will love her forever
I've been an atheist for almost 20 years, this song is extraordinarily powerful. Anyone saying otherwise is lying! Absolutely chilling.
Song is so good thx god fir giving us people that worship you🙏
(Translate it on google translator, it will help you so much. Traducir) Não é Deus que não se importa com a Gente, é nos mesmos que não nos damos importância quando pensamos assim e deixamos satanás acabar com nossa vida!
É melhor matar a vida de erros do que perder a vida que Deus dá. É melhor perder o pobre do que perder o bom. É melhor sacrificar o que é do pecado, do que sacrificar o que é muito bom...a salvação... o céu que Deus nos oferece como morada se virmos e ficarmos nele, *VERDADEIRAMENTE*! 
As pessoas colocam Jesus no meio de coisa errada e ainda falam que é dele ou pra ele.
Me perdoa Deus 😭
Jesus é o Senhor!
Pray for me everyone I’m starting to loose my strength to keep going. Love you all ❤️
This song draws emotions I never knew I had had . My flaws are forgotten when I praise Jesus …. My heart feels pure,broken, and healed all at once .
So peaceful  this is a great song
A bien y repenser je me dis que ma vie n’à était qu’une succession d’échec je n’ai pas su retenir mes amis je n’ai pas su protéger ni mon honneur ni ma réussite ni même ma santé, j’ai préférer fuir la réalité je suis un solitaire je n’ai pas vis le moment présent j’aurais du mais je n’ai pas pu j’etais bien trop egoiste j’avais trop de haine envers les êtres humains je voulais que les êtres humains paye de toute leur mechancete qu'ils font subir à cette misérable planète,  je ne pensais qu’à moi et ce que j aurais pu avoir apres, j’aurais du profitez de ma jeunesse au lieu de la gâcher comme un lâche j ai perdu mes amis à 14 ans ils ont tous changer... particulièrement 1 qui était mon meilleur ami qui lui je ne le reconnaissais plus , d’un côté c’est normal mais d’un autre côté c’est moche car tu ne les reconnais plus, beaucoup de gens acceptent leur changement mais pas tout le monde , pas moi
J ai eu aussi des problèmes de santé tel que ma virilité ma façon de pouvoir être un garçon être quel qu’un on m’à enlever mon identité qui est ma partie intime, comme si ça ne suffisait pas j ai eu un autre problème de santé qui est central pour pouvoir découvrir le monde qui est mes yeux , ma première maladie je pouvais me dire que c’étais un accident ça n’étais sûrement pas de ma faute alors que mes yeux cela est de ma faute je fais une erreur j’ai abime mes yeux et j’en était conscient, Peut être que si je n’avais pas été solitaire, si j'avais profiter , je n’aurais peut être pas été à ces moments de maladie j'aurais peut être éviter cela ,mais la vie en a décider autrement 
A l’heure d’aujourd'hui Je cherche toujours ce que j ai fais pour souffrir autant
Peut être que je le mérite apres tout
Moi aussi j'aurais aimer connaître le destin mortuaire de ces légendes de connaître la vie que tout le monde connaît que tout le monde découvre et entreprends mais seulement voilà je me trompais sur toute la ligne je ne savais pas qu'elle était le rôle qui m'était attribuer
Je sais que je ne suis pas quel qu un bien, je ne suis pas parfait mais j aurais essayer de changer le monde du mieux que je pouvais
On me disait souvent que je ressemblais a Eren Yeager
J’ai compris que oui je lui ressemblais mais je n’avais pas son pouvoir qui était de pouvoir changer le passé
A toutes les personnes qui lisent ceci je ne suis pas le genre de personne a faire la morale aux autres, Je ne suis personne je n’ai jamais rien été, mais je peux vous dire une chose profitez de votre vie quand il est encore temps , profitez de votre jeunesse ne la gâchez pas comme moi je l’ai fais
Il est malheureusement trop tard pour moi mais peut être pas pour vous
This makes me thinks of Jesus but in his kingdom and everything is gold and more..
This makes me thinks of Jesus but in his kingdom and everything is gold and more..
0:26 they hit that note🔥😱
Very love song ❤️❤️
Fun Fact.
I Once meet a Young Man at the front of My Gates. Before his presence was a younger Gentleman. “Father All Mighty GOD who Art In Heaven,  Behold For Your Son Has Returned”.
Jesus Of Nazareth is The Most detailed Name one will know who I was Talking About.
He Said unto “ Father Those who I have brought and follow me are of Me and have Lost Your ways. May you puré them and punish Me I’ll  take all blame Father”.
The Gates Have REMAINED OPEN ever since.
Y Cuando Ablo Yo escuche.
Me cry, 😭
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." -Steve Jobs
Any atheists out there remember this:
God has a plan for you, meanwhile satan will drag you down to hell, and will never let you leave his grasp. Wherever you are, the spirit is present.
The moment it started I already was starting to tear up because it reminds me of both my grandpa's they passed when I was just 6 and im going to turn 13 in a few months I can never forget them

I'm passing through a hard situation in my life where the school is pushing me down, really! But I know than in Him I can everything. I have something to say to you: the situation can be hard, can be the sadness situation in your life; but give it for Him. God is the God of everything in this world, we're nothing without Him. Just trust'n even when the situation make loud noises 💗

Very beautiful ❤😊😢
I am not alone❤️
To the listener. I pray you have peace and prosperity in all of your endeavors. That those things which are harmful to you seldom cross your path. That you see the same amount of beauty in the stars as you would in the soil beneath your feet. That you may find the good in every person you meet. That you fight the evil in them for the good that every person on earth has. That you know, no matter what you do or how far you fall, you're never too far gone. And may I see you in eternity, after you have heard those words which are so sought after. "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
Make 1 hour version pls

I wrote to my ex-girlfriend to reconcile, but she didn't... she doesn't even know how much I love her, and this music reminds me of her... you will always be in my mind❤️‍🩹😥🤧

That's like so emotional
What a beautiful song.
The peace that this song transmits is indescribable
Oh glória 😢
Beautiful. Brings me to tears. May the power of our Lord shine over us and within our hearts
😡🤜😣🍩 😢
Nice song yet no Christian in 2000 years did what Jesus did when he call Petrus to walk with him on water.  

Even though Jesus said  Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you”

Matthew 17:20.
Room: I'll close the door so people won't see you crying 
Mirror: don't worry I know your true self 
Shower: I won't Make fun of your voice 
Pillows: It's okay I'll be here when you cry
Teddys: I don't care if you hate me you can hug me when you're sad
Light: I'll make it dark so you can sleep 

TV: I hope I calm you down while watching videos
Mind: I'm great at keeping secrets 
Songs: I'll distract you while You thinking something that makes you sad 
Blanket: Hug me if you're sad 

Food: Eat! Eat! Stop starving yourself 
Fan: I hope you'll be okay I am here always so you won't feel hot 
AND THEN PEOPLE SAYS< NO ONE CARES ABOUT US~
Theres no beating this song 😮‍💨
I see a lot of people here, Christians and Non-Christians, but either way, God loves you all so much that he gave his only son to die a gruesome death on a cross to save you, turn to him, God bless you all and may he help you with whatever you are going though, stay strong my brothers and sister. 🙏❤
É incrivel como em pleno 2022 ainda exista o preconceito - toguro 2022
Even I cant deny it as someone who doesn’t listen to this kind of music.  When I heard a little bit of this I was searching for this song to hear the full version in an instant. I don’t regret it in the slightest ❤

Como é bom sentir a presença de Deus 🥺♥️♥️
Em pleno 2022, ano da copa do mundo, ano de eleição
I feel we all say this prayer, we all sing this beautiful worship... But not everyone truly understands what we're asking for when we sing this. To go to a place where our trust is without borders, no place to hold on to when we go blind. To go deeper than what our feet could EVER wander... This isn't a pretty place to be in. It's hard, it's dark, you feel lonely most of the times, but one thing is true... He's actually right there next to you even if you can't see or feel him. It's up to us to actually make our faith grow and make it out of this dark place by walking on water, just like our savior. I pray if you're here, like I am, you can make it out with a faith stronger than what you ever thought possible.
Cuts Me so deep I world we're our only savor is stuck toa cross suffering
I think I raelly made a mistake 

Such as to talk but not be heard 
As to breath with no air 
As to feel without touch 
As to be a memory in your mind and that last moment of of air the last moment of touch the last moment of belief 

Never forget your human and humans do amazing and wonderful things

Em pleno 2022...
I guess I can go on a bit longer.
Foi bom ter conhecido a vida . Compartilhar experiências . Principalmente quando foi alegria . Foi difícil quando a morte chegou . Mas agora estamos em paz 🙏
Em pleno 2022. Ano da copa, do beijo de língua, da diversidade. Você ainda lê esse comentário achando que é uma referência ao toguro?
Século 21, era da tecnologia, ano de eleição. Você já tirou seu título? Bolsonaro ou Lula? E você com preconceito com as pessoas que são diferentes de você? Eu tenho um sonho, aonde todas as pessoas são iguais, o pobre, o rico, o gay, o travesti, o hetero. 
2022 ano da copa, Brasil vai ser Hexa. Vinicius Júnior vai ser reconhecido em todo mundo. Não a mais espaço e lugar para preconceito.
Gotta admit the original is great but the slowed down version is even more iconic.
it’s been 6 years since i’ve heard or even sung this song, missed it so much.
Mn q MSC linda Vey😘😍😍💗💝
Obrigado por tudo
Горела пламенная роза
И свет дыханьем полыхал.
В моих строках исчезла проза,
В стихах накатывал скандал.

В холодном, синем, закалённом,
В солёном, пресном и безвкусном
Ты страстью сладкого потока
Кидая розу, сделал выстрел.

Горел цветок в волнах истошных,
Манил он живностью своей.
Но знала б я, бутон - холодный,
Бутон - рубиновых камней...

Пыталась удержать рубины.
Их свет меня очаровал.
Меня рубины утопили.
Ему плевать. А кто же знал?
Matthew 28 “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”

29 “Come,” he said.

Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”
is this on spotify?
Death Stranding music blissful
Jesus loves you and he sacrificed himself out of love for you 🤍🤍

THIS IS A GOSPEL SONG?!
Spirits leads me 
😇😇😇
slow calm relaxing
Just wanted to let u know that ur not alone. Even though life is hard know that the Lord is with us every step of the way. Never give up. Even if the enemy knocks you down, God will outstretch His hand to you and will bring you back up. It doesn’t matter what we have done or who we used to be all can be forgiven. God doesn’t expect us to be perfect. He doesn’t tell us to come to Him when we have it all together but to come to him as we are. Go to Him with your burdens and worries and anxieties. That brings Him joy and that’s not a burden to Him. Trust and depend on Him.❤️❤️
I’m not religious (I used to be) but when I hear songs like this, it just makes me feel, not hear; FEEL the words. Regardless of our personal beliefs - I just wish we could all be honest, caring and loving to one another ❤️
Could you do Smaller Than 3 by XO7
This song is like walking in heaven while you’re high
0:22
It sounds like a whole stadium is singing with the singer♥️
God bless you all
Who ever reads this don’t stop. You made it this far for a reason. Remember when you lack motivation stay consistent. I love you see you at the top💙
If you're having a hard time in life, it's because you have chains slowing, you down. And God has broken those chains. Life is getting harder, but God has made a door for you full of paradise. But the process of walking through that door that God made is by PUSHING what you're going through in life. Just trust God. And through time and weeks you will notice all the bad stuff, sorrow, pain, that's gone. Because God has broken those chains. And he has set you free. Amen!!🙏🙏 (These are for the people who have a hard time in life)
"Why do we close our eyes when we go to pray, kiss, cry or dream? Because the most beautiful things in life are not seen, but felt with the heart" - Denzel Washington

Perhaps the Hillsong scandal and other bad thins from them coming to light, we still need to grab and trust in God, cause He is the way to life and freedom. God bless everyone! Hugs from Brazil!

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)
When i first heard this song I cried like a baby and i needed that cry.This song is a master piece 💝💝💝💝

Usually the reverb slowed down stuff isn’t anything special, but this feels like I’m sitting in the middle of an arena and everyone is singing just for me.

Can u plz do "can't remember to forget you" by Shakira and rihanna
🌌
😓
Oh my God😭😭😭
POV: you are at your brothers funeral, he was shot in the heart in a drive by and  killed on the spot,  he always joked around about having this song played at his funeral, you and him would joke around and laugh your hearts out, you would spend time together in the car listening to this when you comforted each other, you called him your savior. You always went to Starbucks with him, but those are all now memories, because you hear this song for the last time. It was played at his funeral , and everyone screamed “SAVIOR!” Just like he asked. You cry for him all day, you  know he didn’t deserve it.  But you get to say your respects to him. You say “dear brother, you are and will always be my savior, please don’t forget that, I love you okay?  You  didn’t need to go this fast, but I still love you dead or not. You  will always be in my heart, I love this song, but it’s now horrific without you. I love you.” Next day you took your life.
